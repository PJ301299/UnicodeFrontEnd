## TASK 1
```
This is a basic profile page I created before I saw any templates or any references. 
It uses basic knowledge of html css
along with a very basic understanding of javascript.

## TASK 2
```
This a superior version of a profile page. It is completely different from the task 1 page. 
Here we have not only used HTML CSS and Javascript but also 
Bootstrap to make the webpage responsive to various sizes of the screen.
Some features are:
1.The horizontal navigation bar turns into a hamburger sign that is used to access a
  drop down box which will serve as the navigation bar on the smaller screens.

2.The horizontal display of the education icons becomes vertical when a smaller screen size 
  has been encountered.
  
3.Clicking on each of the icons in the education sub-heading provides information about the same.

## TASK 3
```
This page is developed on the page of task 2. However here we are making it interactive
by asking the user the to enter his/her personal details and that would be subsequently
be displayed on the profile. This basically makes use of two essential elements that is 
HTML forms and javascript functions.
The form has been validated 
Hence fields that are required are denoted with an asterisk.
Also the fields that are required retain their template data on submitting an empty form 
Alerts are generated when you leave a required field empty 
Alerts are also generated if there are invalid email or phone entries
Also,
On smaller screens the 40 60 ratio vanishes and you have the form on top and the page 
following it below.
